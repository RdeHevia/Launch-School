The function from the previous exercise returns the number of occurrences of a word in some text. Although this is useful, there are also situations in which we just want to find the word in the context of the text.

For this exercise, write a function that takes a word and a string of text as arguments, and returns the text with every instance of the word highlighted. To highlight a word, enclose the word with two asterisks ('**') on each side and change every letter of the word to uppercase (e.g., '**HIGHLIGHTEDWORD**').

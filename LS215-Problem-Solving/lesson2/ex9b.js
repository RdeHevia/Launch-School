  - the sentiment of the text
E:
  5 positive, 6 negative -> 5 - 6 = -1 < 0 -> text is negative
ALGORITHM:
  0. Remove all characters that are not alphanumeric or spaces.
  1. Split the text into words
  2. For each word, check if it's a positive / negative word. Add to list if so
  3. Count the positive and negative words
  4. Compute the total count
  5. Log the stats

  0. Declare an empty array to store the matches

    1.1. Find all the matches of that word in the text and add them to the empty array.
